# Quadcopter Dynamics

> Note : Quadcopter, also known as quadrotor, is a UAV with four rotors. The rotors
are directed upwards and they are placed in a square formation with equal distance
from the center of mass of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is controlled by adjusting
the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. Quadcopter
is a typical design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) because of the simple
structure. Quadcopters are used in surveillance, search and rescue, construction
inspections and several other applications.
